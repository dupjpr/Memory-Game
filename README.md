## Description :notebook_with_decorative_cover:

This is my first game using React :video_game:. In this game the user must look for the cards that have the same image. The game will end when the user finds all the pairs and the board is empty. At the end of the game, the user will see the number of times they had to play to complete the pairs of cards.

In this project I call and consult a free API. The API is "Rick and Morty API" and it's about tv show. Below, in the Built With section, you will find the link to the API.
